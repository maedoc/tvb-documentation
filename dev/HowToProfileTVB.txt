TVB profile

After analysing a few tools which allow us to profile a python application we chose
cherrypy profile, for generating the profile data, and for viewing the generated data we use RunSnakeRun.

I. Generate the profile data

In order to profile a certain piece of code using the cherrypy profile please follow the next steps:
 1. Import the profiler into your script
    e.g.: import cherrypy.lib.profiler as profiler
 2. Specify the path where you want to be saved the resulted profile data
    e.g.: p = profiler.Profiler("$path_where_to_save_data")
 3. Pass the method which you want to profile, and its parameters, to the run method of the profiler
    e.g.: p.run($method_to_profile, $method_to_profile_param_0, ...)
 4. run the script
    e.g: python $myScript.py $param_0

Example for profiling the 'do_operation_launch' method from operation_async_launcher.py

import cherrypy.lib.profiler as profiler
....
if __name__ == '__main__':
    OPERATION_ID = argv[1]
    # Make sure DB events are linked.
    db_events.attach_db_events()
    p = profiler.Profiler("d:/TVB/profiler/")
    p.run(do_operation_launch, OPERATION_ID)
    exit(0)

!! Important: When running an operation in profile mode, make sure no other Python calls are running in paralel. Otherwise the results might be wrong.

II. Visualize the profile data

1. Install RunSnakeRun
You will need to have all of wxPython, SquareMap and RunSnakeRun installed to use RunSnakeRun. For Debian/Ubuntu
distributions the prerequisite setup looks like this:
 E.g.: apt-get install python-profiler python-wxgtk2.8 python-setuptools

If you already have Python setuptools installed (a.k.a. easy_install), you should be able to install the Python packages with:
 E.g.: easy_install SquareMap RunSnakeRun

You will require a modern wxPython (e.g. 2.8) and Python 2.x (e.g. 2.5 through 2.7) installation.
The setup will create a script named "runsnake" on Linux machines which launches the profile viewer.
On OS-X machines a wrapper script runsnake is created that runs the runsnake32 executable with a flag to tell
Python to use the 32-bit implementation (for wxPython compatibility).
On Win32 machines, a Scripts\runsnake.exe executable is created.
If you have added your scripts directory to the PATH then this will be available from the command-line.


2. Open the resulted profile data into runsnake
 E.g.: runsnake my_profile_data.prof
